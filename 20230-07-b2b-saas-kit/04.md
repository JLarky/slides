# Some thoughts

## What are the alternatives?

- Epic Stack (Remix, Fly.io, SQLite)
  - https://www.epicweb.dev/epic-stack
- Deno SaaSKit (Fresh, Deno Deploy, Deno KV)
  - https://deno.com/saaskit
- Create T3 App (Next, Vercel, Prisma)
  - https://create.t3.gg/
- any random "buy my template generator for 399$" :)

## Some things to think about

- being opinionated lets you move from project to project, but being flexible lets you keep your project running for years
  - related to that, you can migrate your existing app to this stack without a full rewrite
  - I'm not convinced that I know "the best" way to do things
- slim JS bundles for your landing pages, blog, etc
  - we use that in production at https://fogbender.com/blog
- Astro content collections to manage your blog
  - https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/

## Things I wish were better

- No offline development yet
- No one-click deployment (or a playground)
- Drizzle ORM is not version 1.0 yet
- Propel's support for Astro is not great
- Propel's issues with email delivery
- Vercel's serverless cold starts üêå
- Vercel's pricing üò¨
- Astro's HMR story for React üò± (plug qgp.app)
- More features and integrations, like error tracking, email, cron jobs, etc
