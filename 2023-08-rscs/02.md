# Just a fun note

This talk was supposed to be a comparison between island architecture and RSCs. But then I realized that I talked to a co-creator of Astro for 2 hours trying to explain to him what RSCs are. And I recently talked to a creator of one of the RSCs frameworks for 2 hours trying to explain what islands are...

So I figured it will probably take at least 4 hours to do my original talk :)

So instead we are doing "RSCs for people who already know React and Remix"
