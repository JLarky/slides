# Next, let's talk about hydration

If you ever wondered how full-stack frameworks do hydration, it's going to be extremely similar, just use `hydrateRoot` instead of `createRoot` (and make sure that your HTML matches).

<!-- 2023-08-rscs/demos/simple/04_hydrate.html -->

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"><div>Hello</div></div>
    <script type="module">
      import React from "https://esm.sh/react";
      import { hydrateRoot } from "https://esm.sh/react-dom/client";
      import { jsx } from "https://esm.sh/react/jsx-runtime";

      const App = () => {
        const [name, setName] = React.useState("Hello");
        React.useEffect(() => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            setName("Hello World");
          }, 1000);
        }, []);
        return jsx("div", { children: name });
      };

      hydrateRoot(document.getElementById("root"), jsx(App, {}));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Because we are trying to write a "fully built with React" framework, we want to use React to be able to change stuff like `<title />` and `<meta />` tags. Again, pretty easy, just put more stuff in React root.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"><div>Hello</div></div>
    <script type="module">
      import React from "https://esm.sh/react?dev";
      import { hydrateRoot } from "https://esm.sh/react-dom/client?dev";
      import { jsx, jsxs } from "https://esm.sh/react/jsx-runtime?dev";

      const App = () => {
        const [name, setName] = React.useState("Hello");
        React.useEffect(() => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            setName("Hello World");
          }, 1000);
        }, []);
        return jsx("div", { children: name });
      };

      hydrateRoot(
        document,
        jsxs("html", {
          lang: "en",
          children: [
            jsx("head", {
              children: jsx("title", {
                children: "Title",
              }),
            }),
            jsxs("body", {
              children: [
                jsx("div", {
                  id: "root",
                  children: jsx(App, {}),
                }),
                jsx("script", {
                  suppressHydrationWarning: true,
                  children: "",
                }),
              ],
            }),
          ],
        })
      );
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

At this point let's talk more about `jsx` function (ask me about `jsxs` later). This is literally the code that your bundler is going to generate when converting `.jsx` files to `.js` (that browsers can understand).

But you rarely hear anyone from React team talk about it in the context of RSCs. The reason is pretty simple, it's not clear how would you send a function `jsx(...)` over the wire. So if you read [RSC From Scratch by Dan Abramov](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/5) he talks about this form instead:

```js
// <div> => jsx("div", {}) => { $$typeof: Symbol.for("react.element"), type: "div", props: {} }
const jsx = (type, props) => ({
  "$$typeof": Symbol.for("react.element"),
  type,
  props,
});
```

This is how it works, function `jsx` returns just a plain object marked with `$$typeof` field. `type` is a function for components and a string for elements. Which is easier to see how you would serialize.

## On naming things

When people see

```js
{ $$typeof: Symbol.for("react.element"), type: "div", props: {} }
```

they call it different names, some call it VDOM, some call it React Element, and some call it React Node. Here's my understanding, feel free to correct me :)

- `document.createElement("div")` will create a DOM element
- `React.createElement("div")` will create a primitive React Element
- internally primitive React Elements are going to be used in reconciliation in the form of VDOM (fun fact, React docs don't even define what VDOM is anymore)
- `React.createElement(App)` will create a React Element (not primitive)
- calling a component can return a React Node, which includes React Elements, primitive React Elements, and some primitive values like arrays of React Nodes, strings, numbers, boolean, null, undefined (and maybe some others with various success)
