## Why?

So what can you do in a system that allows you to run some code above your regular root component?

- your server-only code used to live outside of React
  - that would be `getServerSideProps`, `loader`, `meta`, etc
- renderToString had to be sync
  - that means that everything your components will ever need had to be ready before you call it

Now to emulate loaders you just do:

```tsx
export default async function Posts() {
  const posts = await fetchPosts();
  return <>{posts.length}</>;
}
```
