- RSCs were inspired by Relay's idea of each component being able to declare its data dependencies.
- Relay also has a mechanism of lazy loading client code based on the data that is being fetched.
- React components usually generate React Nodes that could be rendered on the client by going down the tree until you get to primitive nodes that you can render to the DOM.
- React Server Components generate React Nodes but some Nodes can be marked as "use client" which tells the framework to stop going down that branch and just render it as a RSC payload instead.
- One could say that React Client components render to virtual DOM, and React Server Components render to virtual Client components :)
- Once you have a hammer of "we can serialize anything" and "we can generate a whole React app on demand", you can start thinking about crazy stuff like serializing components, functions, and promises.
- And once you have that implementing progressively enhanced forms is an easy win.
