## Let's recap

- hydrating server components isn't that complicated
  - just send JSX over the wire
  - you need special logic if you want to send functions (components) or promises (streaming)
  - but it's not that much :)
- everything is handled by React
  <!-- - it's curious to see that there isn't a lot of code that lives "outside of React" even when we are talking about "having server components at the root", but in practice a lot of client-only code lives above that server root -->
  - in Next.js I counted 16 components that live above the <html> tag
- you can easily use `createRoot` instead of `hydrateRoot`
  - which means that SSR is not essential for RSC
  - but it felt a bit more magical to use `hydrateRoot` in my examples :)
- one way of thinking about RSC is that it's kind of like using macros or `comptime` in Zig
  - RSC are more like meta-programming, when they run on the server they generate a separate program that will run in the browser
