## Everyone's expectations are already set

> I believe I understand what problem RSC solves and very few apps have that problem.

## But the reality is changing

Now all of you poor people are going to check your social media apps and all of a sudden you see this:

> When RSC is ready for adoption in Remix, migrating will probably be as easy as renaming one of your route files

## What you will get from this talk

- what problems RSCs solve
- why people were confused by RSCs
- the uncomfortable "well aksually" feeling when other people are going to repeat those "unnecessary complexity" memes near you

## TODO

- Remix won
