# How

I'm going to start with something extremely simple, but because it's usually hidden from you by the framework it could still be extremely surprising.

I'm guessing everyone has seen a very similar code before:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module">
      import React from "https://esm.sh/react";
      import ReactDOM from "https://esm.sh/react-dom";

      const container = <div>Hello</div>;

      ReactDOM.render(container, document.getElementById("root"));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Browsers can't actually run JSX, so the compiled version would look something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module">
      import React from "https://esm.sh/react";
      import ReactDOM from "https://esm.sh/react-dom";
      import { jsx } from "https://esm.sh/react/jsx-runtime";

      const container = jsx("div", { children: "Hello2" });

      ReactDOM.render(container, document.getElementById("root"));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
