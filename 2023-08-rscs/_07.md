## How is that different from traditional SSG/SSR?

You can express previous approaches in this form:

```js
const reactNode = jsxs("html", {
  lang: "en",
  children: [
    // ...,
    jsx(App, getServerSideProps()),
    // ...
  ],
});
```

Then props are just going to become a static JSON that you send inside `jsxString`.

## A few more notes

The more stuff you have that lives in `reactNode` as static JSON the better. That will make your `App` function smaller and you would have to do less work in SSR/hydration because you have to run `App` twice` (once on the server and once on the client).

This also means that you can have as many client components like `App` as you like (each with its own loader/getServerSideProps), compared to traditional SSR frameworks that had just one.

## TODO

So the question is, can I just call a `JSON.stringify` on the whole object and send it over the wire?

The intuition here is that it's going to be easier to do that using this format, compared to the alternative where your whole app is defined inside the `App` function.

With that in mind let's play a bit more with what we have created so far :)
