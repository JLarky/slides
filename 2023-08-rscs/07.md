## Let's talk about serializing React Nodes

In this exercise we are going to take our whole React root starting with `jsx("html", ...)` and serialize it to string `jsxString`, then dehydrate it into `dehydrated` React Element that we can be passed to `hydrateRoot` function.

<!-- 2023-08-rscs/demos/simple/08_serialize.html -->

```js
// live React node
const reactNode = jsxs("html", {
  lang: "en",
  children: [...],
});

function packUnpack(reactNode) {
  const jsxString = JSON.stringify(reactNode, function replacer(key, value) {}, 2);
// --- imagine the devide here ---
  const dehydrated = JSON.parse(jsxString, function reviver(key, value) {});
  return dehydrated;
}

const rehydratedReactNode =  packUnpack(reactNode);
hydrateRoot(document, rehydratedReactNode);
```

If we can make this work, it opens some fun opportunities, like maybe we don't have to have code that generates `reactNode` in the browser anymore, it's enough to just send `jsxString` to the client.
