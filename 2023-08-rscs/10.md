# Let's recap

This is the point where we can say that we know a lot of "how"s of RSCs.

- we saw how client and server intertwine, in a real framework you would see a tree that looks something like this:
  - browser-only framework code (the script that calls `hydrateRoot`)
    - server-only framework code (code that calls `renderToPipeableStream`)
      - client-only framework code (SSR+browser, stuff like `<Router>`, `<Link>`)
      - server-only app code (that's where you return `<html>` tag)
        - client-only app code (that's where you call `useQuery` and `useEffect`)
- so when you hear "RSCs have to have a client component at the root", they mean your app code :) there are plenty of things that live above your "root"
  - in Next.js I counted 16 components that live above the `<html>` tag
- I was surprised to see how little code lives "outside of React", as you saw `RscComponent` wasn't too special, it fetched data and returned React Nodes like any component would
- as for serialization and sending stuff over the wire. We implemented a trivial version that could only send primitive React Elements and one client component element named `App`
  - obviously, in a real implementation, you would add all kinds of `assetsManifest` to help you create separate bundles for each client component, allow you to send CSS, images, etc
  - also you would want to allow sending functions and promises over the wire
  - functions could be serialized as server routes to perform actions
  - promises could be serialized to allow you to stream data from the server to the client
- we could replace `hydrateRoot` with `createRoot` at any moment and not use SSR
  - hopefully, that makes it clear that SSR is not essential for RSCs
  - but it felt a bit more "legit" to use `hydrateRoot` in my examples :)
