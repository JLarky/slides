## Let's talk about getting updates from the server

So we did this hydration trick once, but wouldn't it be cool to run it again with the new data?

I'm going to skip a few steps and go right into trying to write a router that will fetch new data from the server and re-render the app.

<!-- 2023-08-rscs/demos/simple/09_update.html -->

The first step is to put all of our routing logic into a browser-only client component called `ClientRouter`.

```jsx
const ClientRouter = ({ initialClient }) => {
  const [url, setUrl] = React.useState("/");
  const [client, setClient] = React.useState(initialClient);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(async () => {
      setUrl("/new");
    }, 2000);
  }, []);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (url === "/new") {
      setClient(packUnpack(newReactNode));
    }
  }, [url]);
  return client;
};

const initialClient = await packUnpack(reactNode);
hydrateRoot(document, jsx(ClientRouter, { initialClient }));
```

here we imagine that we are switching from one page to another after 2 seconds.

Those pages are going to be very similar but will have a few differences.

```jsx
const reactNode = jsxs("html", {
  children: [
    jsx("head", { children: jsx("title", { children: "Title" }) }),
    jsx("body", {
      children: jsx(App, {}),
    }),
  ],
});

const newReactNode = jsxs("html", {
  children: [
    jsx("head", { children: jsx("title", { children: "New Title" }) }),
    jsx("body", {
      children: jsx(App, { children: jsx("div", { children: "server prop" }) }),
    }),
  ],
});
```

So we expect to see the title meta tag change, as well as we can pass some new props to our client component.

You may or may not be surprised to see that some internal state of the `App` component is going to be preserved when we re-render it. You can use a standard React `key`` prop to force a re-render.
