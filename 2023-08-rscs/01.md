## Narrative 1

Let me know if you heard this narrative:

- Vercel hired everyone from the React team
- Vercel is billing you for serverless functions
- React suddenly requires everyone to use servers
- Coincidence? I think not

## Narrative 2

I'm going to sell you on a narrative I recently came up with:

- Ryan created Component component

```
<Component initialState={{ count: 0 }}>
    {({ setState, state }) => (
        <button onClick={() =>
            setState(state => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
          }
        >increment</button>
    )}
</Component>
```

- React steals that idea and makes hooks
- Ryan creates `createContext`
- React steals that idea and makes `useContext`
- Ryan created Remix
  - allows you to write SQL right in your component file
  - forms work without javascript
  - has transitions
  - has `<Await>` component
- and what does React team do? They introduce all of this with RSCs

## Narrative 3

And here's the last narrative:

- React hooks were based on Eff, Koka, OCaml
  - source https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1641980255568117761
- Vercel is not telling React what to do
  - source https://twitter.com/JLarky/status/1656487452494921729
- RSCs were planned as far back as React v16.6 (2018) when Suspense was introduced
- Relay and GraphQL were introduced even earlier (2015)
- The best way to understand RSCs is to think of it as a way to bring Relay functionality to core React
- well, I still think that most of PE and loader/actions story was directly inspired by Remix :) because that was an easy win

The last one seems to be the easiest one to prove. That's what we are doing today. Well, just about RSCs, I'm not going into Component component ðŸ˜‚
