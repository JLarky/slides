Second way of looking at RSCs (data loading)

# Remix won data loading

Every modern framework has Remix style loaders:

- Remix and React Router - loader/action
- SvelteKit - load/actions
- Qwik - routeLoader$/routeAction$
- SolidJS - routeData/createRouteAction

Well, maybe not everyone, the rest are doing TanStack Query style data loading:

- Next - tRPC
- Nuxt - useAsyncData
