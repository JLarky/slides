Second way of looking at RSCs (progressive enchancement)

# Why do I need 275kb (77kb gzipped) of JS to render a page with one `div`?

I don't know about you, but when I see this in a `src/app/page.tsx` file (Next.js 13):

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>Home</div>
  );
}
```

It's not immediately obvious why I need so much JS. And that's before I even started adding any of my own dependencies!

# Cost of JS

On slow 3G it will take me at least 2 seconds to download 100kb of JS (and depending on CPU it could take seconds to parse it on a phone). Which means that it could be 5-15 seconds of dead HTML that is not interactive or worse, I could start writing something in a search box and then `setState('')` is called and my input gets cleared ðŸ˜¡
