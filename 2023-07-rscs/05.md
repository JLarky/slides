Second way of looking at RSCs (progressive enchancement)

# No one likes big bundles

One more quiz! How much javascript do you think this static page needs in Next.js?

```tsx
"use server";
// src/app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>Home</div>
  );
}
```

275kb (77kb gzipped)

It's not immediately obvious why I need so much JS. And that's before I even started adding any of my own dependencies!

# Cost of JS

On slow 3G it will take me at least *2 seconds* to download 100kb of JS (and depending on the CPU it could take seconds to parse it on a phone). This means that it could be 5-15 seconds of dead HTML that is not interactive or worse, I could start writing something in a search box and then `setState('')` is called and my input gets cleared ðŸ˜¡

New in React:

 - Selective hydration. If you are using Suspense and streaming your app is not going to be hydrated in one go, which means that it can prioritize what to hydrate first, and events would be captured and replayed once the component is hydrated
 - Progressive Enhancement. Forms in React can work without JS now. This one is a bit more complicated...
