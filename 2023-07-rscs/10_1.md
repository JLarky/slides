Okay, now that we know the room, let's get to know RSCs.

# What are RSCs?

- New loading primitive (async components)
- New mutation primitive (server actions)
- New way to separate your app into server and client parts (use client, use server)
- New way to hydrate your client (selective hydration)
- New way to handle client side routing
- New progresive enhancement primitive (forms can work without JS)

# What RSCs are not

- Not a scam to make Vercel more money https://twitter.com/JLarky/status/1656487452494921729
  - React needs Vercel more than Vercel needs React (hi SvelteKit)
  - By default Next.js is building static sites
- Not Angular 2 or Vue 3 moment
  - The old way of writing React is still possible
  - Most of the third party libraries will continue to work (with some workarounds)
  - You can still use tRPC or React Query https://github.com/solaldunckel/next-13-app-router-with-trpc
  - you will still be able to use react-router, just not with Next.js
- Aslo not ready
  - No docs (remember how long it took to see hooks documented?)
  - No examples
  - No compatibility database like ProtonDB
  - No implementations outside of Next.js

# What RSCs are going to kill

- Runtime based CSS-in-JS and I'm personally very glad about that
- React frameworks without a router (CRA, Vite), there's basically no way to implement RSCs without a router
- 

Keep in mind that everyone who talks about RSCs is going to focus on a few aspects of it, because it's impossible to care about everything at once.
