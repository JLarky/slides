# RSC quiz

## First question

```tsx
function Note({ note }) {
  return (
    <Toggle>
      <Details note={note} />
    </Toggle>
}
```

```tsx
"use client"
function Toggle({ children }) {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false)
  // at some point `setIsOn(true)`
  return <>{isOn ? children : null}</>
}
```

what happens when you `setIsOn(true)`?

- (0) Details gets fetched
- (0) Details appears instantly

## Second question

now say `isOn` is `true`. You’ve edited the note and told the router to “refresh” the route. this refetches the RSC tree for this route, and your `Note` server component receives a `note` prop with latest DB content.

does `Toggle` state get reset?

- (0) Yes
- (0) No

does Details show fresh content?

- (0) Yes
- (0) No

## Third question

here’s a little twist.

```tsx
<Layout
  left={<Sidebar />}
  right={<Content />}
/>
```

all are Server components. but now your want to add a bit of state to `Layout`, like column width, that changes on mouse drag.

can you make `Layout` a Client component? if yes, what happens on drag?

- (0) No, this isn’t allowed
- (0) They all refetch on drag
- (0) No refetches on drag
